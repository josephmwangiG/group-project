<!-- maize -->


Maize is an important food which is eaten in form of grains, processed to offer various product ranges including maize flour, used to make Kenya’s common meal ugali & porridge, vegetable oils and sometimes fermented to produce alcohol to make local beer. Its remnants after harvesting are used as fodder and can be used to make silage when completely dried.

ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS

Maize crop is adaptable to a wide range of climatic conditions and it is thus grown extensively in the country.

Rainfall– the crop can flourish in regions with different rainfall ranges. For instance, a high rainfall of 1200- 2500mm, at times 600-1150mm and can also adapt to regions receiving rainfall total of 400mm. Rainfall requirements vary with different varieties but should be evenly distributed during the growing period, especially during the first five weeks after planting and at flowering stage.

Temperature– warm temperatures of between 15-30 C are fit for the growth and development of this crop. Cold conditions extend the maturity period.

Soil– maize crop prefers a well-drained light loam or alluvial soil with a pH of between 5.5-7.0. However, it also tolerates a wide range of soils found in most parts of Kenya but it is not tolerant to waterlogged soils.

Altitude– the crop grows in a wide range of zones with altitude ranging from 100-2900M ASL. This however depends on the maize variety.

CHOICE OF SEED

It is very important to choose the right seed for your altitude and rainfall conditions.

For example;

H614, H626, H627- for attitudes range of 1500- 2100 M ASL
KATUMANI, DH O2, DH O4, Drought TEGO- for attitudes of 600- 1300M ASL
H 513, H 511, H 516- attitudes of 800- 1500 M ASL
PH1, PH4- for attitude range of 0-1200M ASL
LAND PREPARATION

It should be done early to allow for weeds to dry and decompose before planting. First plough is best done after harvesting the previous crop.

Procedure

Spray weeds with CATAPULT® 480SL 200ml/20L.
Plough land and make it level with a fine tilth.
Mix soil with manure and DAP. For efficient and improved nutrient uptake as well as stabilizing soil pH, mix 1kg HUMIPOWER® with 50kg DAP and /or 1 ton of manure.
Make holes at a spacing of 90*30-50cm if soil fertility is low or 75*25-50cm if soil is fertility is relatively high.
Place either 2 or 1 seed per hole or alternate 1 and 2 seeds at a depth of about 4cm if soil is moist and about 10cm if soil is dry.
Cover seeds with loose soil
Considering the size of land, machines like tractors or ox-drawn ploughs can be used, observing the correct spacing.

NB; Optimal yields are realized if the correct number of plants per unit area are grown.

PLANTING TIME

Early planting is essential as yields are greatly reduced by late planting.

Planting is best done within the first two weeks of the onset of rainfall in highlands, while in lowlands, maize is best planted before the onset of rain for it to benefit from the scarce rainfall in these areas.

If the rainfall is not enough, irrigation should be done.

FIELD OPERATIONS

Thinning & Gapping

Gapping is done to replace ungerminated seeds immediately after germination is complete while thinning is done when maize has grown to height of about 15 cm by removing the weak and deformed seedlings to leave the desired number of seedlings per hole.

Fertilizer application

Timely application of both basal and foliar fertilizers is highly recommended in order to achieve optimum yields. Manure should be added especially for soils with little or no organic matter.

During planting

When planting manually, place a teaspoonful of fertilizer (DAP) into each planting hole, mix it thoroughly with the soil to make sure that the fertilizer doesn’t burn the seeds, then place the seeds. Under mechanical planting well calibrated planters with fertilizer hoppers are used. The fertilizer can also be mixed with soil before planting, at a rate of 50Kg per acre.

DAP contains phosphorus which helps the crop with root development.

Spray the young plants with LAVENDER SUPER STARTER® 20ml/20L or GATIT SUPER START® 50g/20L to promote early crop establishment

Top dressing

Top dressing with CAN is done after 2-3 weeks after planting or when the crop is 45cm or 1.5ft high. Apply 1 teaspoonful of fertilizer (CAN) at the base of each plant in a ring or along the row, about 15 cm away from the plant. In high rainfall areas top dressing is done in two splits. 1st split is done 6 weeks after sowing and 2nd split is done 10-15 days later or just before tasseling. In low rainfall areas fertilizer is applied once, at a rate of 50-100Kg per acre.

CAN fixes nitrogen in the soil which increases the green color of the leaves, responsible to make food for the plant. Other nitrogenous fertilizers like urea can be used.

To promote vigorous vegetative growth of the crop, spray it with GATIT SUPER GROWTH® 50g/20L or LAVENDER SUPER GROWTH & VEGETATIVE® 20ml/20L.

During flowering and grain filling stages, spray GATIT SUPER FLOWERS & FRUITS® 50g/20L or DIMIPHITE® 20ml/20L, to promote quality and quantity production.

Weeding

Weeds compete with maize for nutrients, water and light and harbor diseases and pests which lowers yields.

Weeding can be done mechanically/manually or by use of herbicides.

If done manually, the first weeding should be within the 3rd week after planting or depending on the growth of weed in the area.

In pure stand, herbicides can be used to effectively control weeds. The herbicides are mainly grouped in two, pre-emergence herbicides (e.g. CATAPULT® 480SL) which are applied before the maize germinates and weeds appear, and post-emergence herbicides (e.g. AGROMINE® 860SL) which are applied when the maize and weeds have germinated.

After planting, before germination, spray weeds with CATAPULT® 480SL 200ml/20L to get rid of all types of weeds.
When maize crop is at knee high stage, about 30cm high, spray AGROMINE® 860SL 150ml/20L which selectively kills broadleaved weeds.
Spray HURRICANE® 200SL 200ml/20L between the rows, when maize is waist high, at later stages of growth. It clears all types of weeds leaving the fields weed-free.
The field should be kept weed free till maize tasseling after which their presence might not cause crop loss.

MAJOR PESTS & DISEASES

Pests

Fall armyworm– it attacks the crop at seedling, vegetative, flowering and fruiting growth stages and its rapid spread and the damage potential can cause up to 100% crop loss

Also Read  Sorghum Production
Use OCCASION STAR® 200SC 3ml/20L or TOTAL TOUCH® 250SC 18ml/20L or ESCORT® 19EC 10ml/20L

Apply the insecticides in the evening or early in the morning for effective control because fall armyworms are nocturnal

Stalk borer– the larvae are caterpillars which feed on leaves. As infestation continues, they find their way into the stalk of the plant, feed on the stalk tissues making the stalk weak. They also tunnel into maize cobs causing significant losses.

Spray KINGCODE ELITE® 50EC 10ml/20L or PROFILE® 440EC 30ml/20L or LEXUS® 247SC 8ml/20L

Maize aphids– these are soft bodied insects which feed by piercing and sucking. Heavy infestation by these aphids causes leaves to curl and become distorted. Plant also becomes stunted. As they feed, the secrete honeydew which encourages the development of sooty mold which lowers the rate of photosynthesis, especially if on the leaves. Aphids are also vectors of viral diseases.

Spray KINGCODE ELITE® 50EC 10ml/20L or LEXUS® 247SC 8ml/20L or PENTAGON® 50EC 10ml/20L

Cutworms- these are found in the soil and attack the stems of young plants.

Drench soil with PROFILE® 440EC 60ml/20L or PENTAGON® 50EC 20ml/20L

Diseases

Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) – this is a combination of two viral diseases which can attack the crop at any stage of growth and development. Infection is shown by the appearance of chlorotic mottling on leaves which starts from the older to the younger leaves. Leaves also show marginal necrosis which extends to the midrib as infection advances eventually causing the leaf to die. Dead hearts are very common.

Control vectors (aphids, thrips and leaf beetles) then spray ensure proper nutrition.

Maize smut–this is a soil borne disease which is manifested in the tassel or kernel of the crop causing severe crop losses. Infection causes formation of whitish galls/swellings which rapture releasing dark spores.

Drench soil with PYRAMID® 700WP 100g/20L or GREEN COP® 500WP 100g/20L

Northern leaf blight– infection starts as gray-green lesions on the leaves which turn pale gray as infection progresses.

Spray GEARLOCK TURBO® 250WP 25g/20L or FORTRESS GOLD® 720WP 40g/20L

Tip! Use certified seeds, resistant varieties and practise crop rotation.

HARVESTING & STORAGE

Maize matures after 3-4 months especially for the short season varieties with others going up to 10 months or more. Harvesting can be done while the maize is green or when dry. Cobs are harvested by hand or by use of mechanized harvesters e.g. combine harvesters.

Maize should be properly dried before storage.

Treat your maize before storage against storage pests like weevils or use treated gunny bags. This increases their shelf-life.

Store the maize in clean and dry storage places or silos to prevent fungal disease attack and to control storage pests like weevils.




<!-- tomatoes -->

Ecological Requirements

Before planting tomatoes, the following factors should be considered:-

Location for planting:- Water proximity should be as close as possible to the planting field to avoid added costs of pumping water. Although water tanks can be used and this is specifically suitable when using a drip irrigation system.

The previous crop planted:- Tomatoes should not be planted immediately after potatoes or pepper and a 3 month break should be observed. This is to minimize on the risk of diseases and reduce costs on disease management.

Topology:- Gently sloping land is best as it facilitates drainage during rainy periods especially for open-air method.

Soil:- The soil should be deep well-drained loam. The soil should be prepared well and loosened and broken down well. The optimal pH for tomatoes is around 6-7.5. Soil analysis can be done to determine this and help you come up with the list of required fertilizer to prepare the land. If the pH is low, lime can be used to raise it and if high, gypsum can be used to lower it.

Nursery Preparation

The nursery is prepared by raising soil around 15cm high and leaving spaces for walkways of around 30cm or more between beds. The soil should be fine and made up of small particles. This is to make it easier for the small seeds of tomatoes to break through. The seeds should not be buried deep into the soil but planted at a depth of around 1cm. The tomato seeds should be covered just slightly with soil. Spacing between rows should be around 15cm. To increase moisture level, mulch is to be added on the seedbed. This also reduces splash effect during watering.

Watering is best done in the morning and the seeds are expected to start showing/sprouting in around 8 days. The watering should continue until a week or two before transplanting where it is reduced to harden off the seedlings. It takes about a month before transplanting is required.

Transplanting

The nursery is watered thoroughly before transplanting for ease of uprooting the seedlings. Transplanting is done using a garden trowel. It is good practice to ensure that the roots carry a ball of soil during transplanting to increase success rate after transplanting. It should be done early in the morning or in the evening.

Also Read  Personal safety in chemical crop protection
Planting

The seedlings are then planted in holes with a spacing of around 60 by 45

Fertilizer Application

phosphate fertilizer is applied at the base for root development and urea or CAN used for leaf development after transplanting. Urea is applied at 2-3 weeks or CAN after 5 weeks. At the start of flowering, top dress with NPK and this can be repeated after the first harvest. Remember that fertilization is done to compensate for soil deficiency.

Watering

It is important to ensure that the plants get adequate water supply. Excessive watering is however not good for the plants as it may cause leaching of nutrients.

Tomato Support

This is done by tying a plant vertically using a string and poles. Two poles are connected using a wire and plants suspended using strings that are tied to it. This method increases the productivity of tomatoes. The plants grow vertically having several fruit clusters along the stem. Support should be done early after transplanting when the plant is still young to avoid stem damage/breaking later on.

Pruning

Pruning should be carried out on side shoots, old leaves, diseased leaves, and laterals. This should be done weekly to remove side shoots before they develop. Remove suckers that grow on the joint between two branches. These suckers will never bear fruit but only take away energy from the plant. This can also be done on the other parts of the plant but be cautious not to remove productive parts.

As the plant begins to mature, the lower leaves will naturally begin to yellow and wilt. This is perfectly normal, so pull these from the plant when they appear. It will keep the plant fresh, looking good, and help ward off disease.

Weeding

Weeding should be done regularly as weeds compete for nutrients with the plants

Pest and Diseases

Pests include:-

American Bollworm

Is the larva stage of a moth that may be brown, green or pink in color? It is the most destructive stage of the moth and attacks fruits of tomatoes. It lays several eggs on young fruits that bear holes on the fruits upon them hatching. The worm feeds with its head inside the tomato fruit.




<!-- beans cultivation -->
Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is considered as one of the most important legumes worldwide, which is a source of nutrients to many people. It is a staple food crop in Kenya, which rates second after maize.

The crop is grown in almost all regions in Kenya. However, Eastern, Nyanza, Central, Western and Rift valley are the major bean growing provinces.

Bean crops grow with very minimum care and adds Nitrogen to the soil.

VARIETIES

A wide range of bean varieties are grown in Kenya. These include the following;

Rose Coco
Mwitemania
Wairimu
Mwezi Moja
Canadian W
KK 15
ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS

Soil– bean crop thrives in a well-drained soil which is rich in organic matter, weed free and has an optimum PH of 6.5-7.5. Growth is poor in waterlogged soils.
Altitude– the crop does well at an optimum altitude range of up to between 1000-2100M ASL. It however tends to grow and mature faster in low altitude zones.
Rainfall– a well distributed annual rainfall of between 800-2000mm is suitable for the rain fed production. Irrigation should be done if rainfall is inadequate. Too much rain or long dry spells are not conducive and reduces yields. Excessive rainfall during flowering causes flower abortion and increased disease incidences. Dry weather conditions are needed during harvesting.
Temperature– beans grow in temperatures ranging from 15-33 degree centigrade. However, an optimum growing temperature of 20-25 degrees centigrade is essential. Relatively high temperatures affect flowering and pod setting processes. The crop is very sensitive to frost.
PLANTING

Propagation is by seeds.

It is advisable to use certified seeds or those that are disease free. Wrinkled, damaged and diseased seeds should not be planted.

Planting should be done at the onset of the rains if production is rain fed. Delay in sowing may lead to crop failure or reduced yield.

Seeds are planted at a spacing of 40*15cm (2seeds per hill) or 30*15cm (1seed per hill), at a depth of 1-2 inches.

The crop can be intercropped with others like maize.

Seeds germinate within 4-7days, depending on the variety and environmental factors.

NB; Do not plant beans where soil Nitrogen is too high or where green manure crops were grown. This is because, the crops will produce green foliage with very few beans.

PESTS & DISEASE MANAGEMENT

Pests

Cutworms– these are brown or black caterpillars usually found in the soil, which cut the stem of younger plants below the soil surface.
Dress seeds with SHIELD 600FS 3ml/kg

DRENCH soil with PROFILE 440EC 60ml/20l or PENTAGON 50EC 20ml/20l

Bean fly– the larva tunnels into the plant stem damaging the vascular tissue, causing reduced plant vigour and petiole droop in older crops. Severe infestations can lead to death of seedling. Crops are at a greater risk for 3-4weeks after emergence, however, later on, crops can be attacked.
Do seed dressing with SHIELD 600FS 3ml/kg

Drench soil with EMERALD 200SL 20ml/20l or PROFILE 440EC 60ml/20l

Spray KINGCODE ELITE 50EC 10ml/20l or LEXUS 247SC 8ml/20l to kill the adults.

Red spider mites– these are tiny reddish yellow pests found on the undersides of the leaves. Their feeding leads to formation of yellow stipples on leaf surfaces they form webs in cases of heavy infestations.

Spray ALONZE 50EC 5ml/20l or BAZOOKA 18EC 10ml/20l

Aphids- these are soft bodied, green, black or brown insects which suck plant sap. Infested leaves curl and crinkle. They also attack the pods. As they feed, they excrete honeydew which encourages the development of sooty mold which reduces photosynthetic area.
Spray KINGCODE ELITE 50EC 10ml/20l or PENTAGON 50EC 10ml/20l or LEXUS 247SC 8ml/20l

Spray JAMBO CLEAN 100ml/20l to get rid of the sooty mold.

Leaf miners– the larva (caterpillar) mines under the leaf surface, resulting into development of mines / winding trails. Heavy infestations lead to death of the leaves.
Spray ALONZE 50EC 3m/20l or ESCORT 19EC 10ml/20l or EPITOME ELITE 500SP 10g/20l

Pod borer– African bollworm is the most common borer which feeds on leaves, flowers and pods thus damaging them. It bores holes on pods and feed on the seeds, with its head inside the pod and the rest of the body outside.
Spray KINGCODE ELITE 50EC 10ml/20l or BACIGUARD 16WD 15g/20l or PENTAGON 50EC 10ml/20l

Whiteflies– these are white insects which suck plant sap. Infested leaves curl, become distorted and eventually drop. They secrete honeydew as they feed which facilitates the development of sooty mold on the leaves affecting photosynthesis.
Spray TAURUS 500SP 10g/20l or LEXUS 247SC 8ml/20l   or PROFILE 440EC 30ml/20l

Spray JAMBO CLEAN 100ml/20l to clean the sooty mold.

Thrips– they feed on leaves and flowers by sucking the sap. Heavy infestations lead to flower and flower buds abortion. Leaves fall off.
Spray ALONZE 50EC 5ml/20l or DEFENDER 25EC 40ml/20l or PROFILE 440EC 30ml/20l

Diseases

Bean rust– infection leads to formation of reddish brown pustules on leaves, pods and stems. Heavy infections cause plant death.
Spray MILESTONE 250SC 10ml/20l or DUCASSE 250EW 20ml/20l or RANSOM 600WP 15g/20l

Downy mildew- infection begins on the underside of the leaf which leads to formation of whitish or grey mass of fungal growth. The upper side of the leaf becomes chlorotic. Pods develop whitish patches.
Spray GEARLOCK TURBO 250WP 25g/20lor FORTRESS GOLD 720WP 40g/20l or TOWER 720WP 50g/20l

Anthracnose– infection causes development of brown to black sunken lesions on pods, stems and seeds. Attacked leaves have black spots.
Spray RANSOM 600WP 15g/20l or ABSOLUTE 375SC 10ml/20l or DUCASSE 250EW 20ml/20l

Bacterial blight– symptoms begin as small brown blotches on the leaves which enlarge as infection continues eventually causing the leaves to fall off and subsequent death of the plant follows.
Spray GREENCOP 500WP 50g/20l or COLONIZER 440WP 50g/20l or TRINITY GOLD 425WP 50g/20l

Fusarium wilt– plants show sudden yellowing of leaves which eventually fall off, resulting into withering of the plant. The vascular tissues are discoloured.
Drench soil with GREENCOP 500WP 100g/20l

Spray COLONIZER 440WP 50g/20l or TRINITY GOLD 425WP 50g/20l

NUTRITION

For optimal production, it is important to ensure that the crop is supplied with sufficient nutrients, both macro and micro nutrient elements. This is because, if deprived of such nutrients, the crop becomes weak and very susceptible to attack by pathogens. This subsequently leads to reduced yield.

During planting, application of DAP is recommended. Considering the amount of organic matter in the soil, manure can also be applied. In order to improve on nutrient uptake by the plants as well as stimulating their growth, the fertilizer and/or manure should be mixed with HUMIPOWER at the rate of 1kg Humipower into 1 ton manure or 50kg basal fertilizer.

Also Read  Finger Millet Farming
4-5 weeks after germination, top dressing should be done. CAN is used, which should also be mixed with HUMIPOWER.

However, these basal fertilizers should be supplemented with foliar fertilizers because they have a wide range of nutrient elements which are very vital to the plants.

These foliar feeds include;

OPTIMIZER 10ml/20l– this is a stress manager, helps in boosting plant’s immunity, prevents flower abortion among other benefits and can be sprayed at any stage of the crop development. It contains both macro and micro nutrient elements.
GATIT SERIES 50g/20l – this takes care of the crop at the different stages of growth and development, e.g., Gatit Super Start ( early crop development), Gatit Super Flowers & Fruits (for flowering and fruiting/pod development stages).
WEED CONTROL

Weeding should be done in order to avoid losses attributed to weed infestation. This is because they compete with the crop for nutrients, water, space, among others, as well as harbouring pests and diseases.

CLAMPDOWN 480SL 200ml/20l is used to kill all types of weeds during land preparation. This helps in reducing the development of weeds, even throughout the crop season.
HOTLINE 450SC 50ml/20l is a selective herbicide used to kill weeds in bean garden before the crop emergences.
After emergence and before flowering, weeding is essential.

NOTE; whenever doing any foliar spray, the product (insecticide, fungicide, foliar feed or herbicide) should be mixed with INTEGRA 3ml/20l. This is a sticker, spreader, wetter and penetrant, which improves the efficacy of the product.

MATURITY, HARVEST & POST-HARVEST HANDLING

Depending on the various varieties, beans are ready for harvesting 70-120 days after sowing. Others take shorter periods. At maturity, the plants have matured and leaves turned yellowish to brown or fallen.

Beans can be harvested green or when dry.

Pods are harvested when completely dry. However, if they have withered but are still moist, they can be picked and sun dried.  Plants can also be uprooted if most of the pods are ready for harvesting.

Pods that are completely dry split open, exposing the dried beans.

Dry beans are stored in treated gunny or PICS bags which help to prevent major damages caused by storage pests. It is advisable to incorporate the seeds with an insecticide, e.g. Actellic super to prevent damages while in the store by pests. Bags should be placed on pallets, not directly on the floor.

Green beans can be refrigerated for 8-10 days.

Dried beans can be stored in a cool, dry place for up to a year or more.

Introduction:
Wheat (Triticum spp.) occupies the prime position among the food crops in the world. In India, it is the second important food crop being next to rice and contributes to the total foodgrain production of the country to the extent of about 25%. Wheat has played a very vital role in stabilizing the foodgrain production in the country over the past few years.

The origin of the durum wheats was probably in the region of Abyssinia, whereas the whole group of soft wheat, which includes the bread wheats, probably originated in the region of Pakistan, SouthWestern and the Southern parts of mountainous Bokhara.

Classification of Indian Wheats:
1. Emmer Wheat (Triticum dicoccum schub L.) :
This type was reported to be grown in south i.e. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. This type is believed to be developed from T. diccoides koru., a wild form. It is also grown in Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia.

2. Macroni Wheat ( T.durum Desf.) : The durum or macroni wheat, cultivation in India, is considered to be very old. It is a best wheat for drought conditions or under restricted irrigated conditions of Punjab, M.P., Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal and H.P. It is used for semolina (suji) preparation.

3. Common Bread Wheat ( T. vulgare Host) :
It is a typical wheat of alluvial soils of Indo-Gangetic plains i.e.Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and parts of Rajasthan. The bulk of the Indian crop, therefore, consists of this type.

4. Indian Dwarf Wheat (T.spherococcum Mihi.) :
This belongs to the club wheat of western countries. This is found in limited areas of M.P., U.P., of India and in Pakistan. These are characterised by very short and compact heads having a shorter grains.

5. Triticum aestivum :
This is the type presently grown in India in almost all the wheat growing zones. It is used mainly for bread purpose.

Climate and Soil:
The ideal temperature requirement varies from plant type and stages of growth. The dwarf varieties require the following temperature for their growth and development:

Growth stages	Temperature requirement
Germination	20 to 25 0 C mean daily temperature
Tillering	16 to 20 0 C mean daily temperature
Accelerated growth	20 to 23 0 C mean daily temperature
Proper grain filling	23 to 25 0 C mean daily temperature.
Wheat plants are sensitive to very cold or frost injury at any stage of growth particularly at reproductive growth if temperature is below 150

Land Preparation:
The wheat crop requires a well-pulverized but compact seed bed for good and uniform germination. Three or four ploughings in the summer, repeated harrowing in the rainy season, followed by three or four cultivations and planking immediately before sowing produce a good, firm seed bed for the dry crop on alluvial soils. For the irrigated crop, the land is given a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa or raund) and the number of ploughings is reduced. Where white ants or other pests are a problem, Aldrin 5% or BHC 10% dust at the rate of 25 kg/ha should be applied to the soil after the last ploughing or before planking.

Based on above temperature requirement it has been found that for indigenous wheat last week of October, for long duration dwarf varieties like Kalyansona, Arjun, etc. first fortnight of November and for short duration dwarf wheats like Sonalika, Raj 821 etc. second fortnight is the best sowing time. Under exceptionally late sown condition it may be delayed to latest by 1st week of December beyond which if area is very small transplanting may be practiced.

b) Seed rate:
Generally, a seed rate of 100 kg/ha has been found to be sufficient for most of the varieties like Kalyan Sona, Arjun, Janak, etc.which have moderate tillering and medium sized grains. But a higher seed rate of 125 kg/ha is desirable for late sown wheat and normal sown for varieties like Sonalika, Raj 821 etc. which have bold grains and shy tillering habits.

c) Spacing: :
For irrigated, timely sown wheat, a row spacing of 15 to 22.5 cm is followed, but 22.5 cm between the rows is considered to be the optimum spacing. Under irrigated late-sown conditions, a row spacing of 15-18 cm is the optimum. For dwarf wheats, the planting depth should be between 5 and 6 cm. Planting beyond this depth results in a poor stand. In the case of conventional tall varieties, the depth of sowing may be 8 or 9 cm.

d) Seed treatment:
The seed of loose smut-susceptible varieties should be given solar or hot-water treatment. If the wheat seed is used only for sowing, and not for human consumption or for feeding cattle, it can be treated with Vitavax.

Application of Mannures and Fertilizer
It is desirable that 2 to 3 tonnes of farmyard manure per hectare or some other organic matter is applied 5 or 6 weeks before sowing. The fertilizer requirement of the irrigated wheat crop are as follows:
With assured fertilizer supply:
Nitrogen (N) @8- - 120 kg/ha
Phosphorus (P2O5) @ 40- 60 kg/ha
Potash (K2O) @ 40 kg/ha.

Under fertilizer constraints:
N @ 60-80 kg/ha
P2O5 @ 30-40 kg/ha
K2O @ 20-25 kg/ha.


Total quantity of Phosphorus and potash and half the quantity of nitrogen should be applied at the time of sowing. Remaining quantity of Nitrogen should be applied at the time of crown root initiation.For the late sown irrigated wheat crop, the NPK fertilizer dose recommended is:
N – 60-80 kg/ha
P2O5 – 30-40 kg/ha
K2O – 20-25 kg/ha.
Interculture:
Generally weeding is done after 1 ½ to 2 months after sowing or weedicides like 2,4 D, Avadex or Nitrofen (Tok E-25) for controling Chenopodium sp, Angallis sp. Asphodelus sp. Phalaris sp. of weeds.

Irrigation:
The high yielding wheat varieties should be given five to six irrigations at their critical growth stages viz. Crown root initiation, tillering, jointing, flowering, milk and dough which come at 21-25 days after sowing (DAS), 45-60 DAS, 60-70 DAS, 90-95 DAS, 100-105 DAS and 120-125 DAS respectively. Off these irrigation at CRI stage is most important.

Plant Protection Measures:
a)Disease control: For controlling diseases following chemicals are used.

Harvesting and Storage:
a) Harvesting:
The rain-fed crop reaches the harvest stage much earlier than the irrigated crop. The crop is harvested when the grains become hard and the straw becomes dry and brittle.The harvesting is mostly done by sickle. The crop is threshed by treading with cattle on the threshing-flour or by power driven thresher.

b) Yield:
The national average yield of wheat grain is about 12 to 13.8 quintals per hectare.

c) Storage:
The grains should be thoroughly dried before storage. The storage life of the grain is closely related to its moisture content. Grains with less than 10 percent moisture store well. The storage pits, bins or godowns should be moisture-proof and should be fumigated to keep down the stored – grain pests including rats. Zinc phosphide is very effective against rats.


<!-- irrigation Farming -->
WHAT IS IRRIGATION?
Irrigation is the process of watering your crops in a controlled way. Instead of relying on increasingly unreliable rainfall, irrigation means you can tailor the amount of water you use and when, by what each crop needs to grow best. 

HOW DOES IRRIGATION BENEFIT SMALLHOLDERS?
Irrigation has many benefits for smallholder farmers!

By giving your crops the correct amount of water, you will be improving their growing conditions. Too much water can cause stunted plant growth as soil that is waterlogged reduces oxygen getting to the roots, and too little water means your crops will dry up.

Irrigation can also reduce water loss on your farm, making it an efficient way to water your crops. You control how much water you use and you can choose to irrigate in cooler periods of the day when the sun is not as strong, reducing evaporation. You can also reduce evaporation by choosing irrigation methods that give smaller, steady amounts of water to your plants.

Lots of irrigation methods can be set up and left to irrigate your crops, meaning less labour for you and more time to get other things done.

This is why irrigation has been widely seen to increase the quality and yield of crops!

Another big benefit of irrigation is not having to wait for the rains, with a water source near your farm you can keep growing crops all year round.

WHAT TYPES OF IRRIGATION ARE THERE?
There are many different ways to irrigate on your farm, and what you choose will depend on your crops, soil, budget and water source.

Irrigation methods range from the simple and easy, to those requiring the purchase of specialised equipment. Below, we have highlighted some of the main irrigation types we see on smallholder farms:

Sprinkler irrigation
Sprinkler irrigation – 3 to 4 sprinklers are optimum for the Futurepump SF2 solar pump
SPRINKLERS

One of the most popular types of irrigation we see on smallholder farms. They are affordable and very easy to use.

Sprinklers are attached to sections of hose pipe with connectors and water is supplied by either a water pump or water tank. They are moved around the farm to evenly water all the crops.

Water droplets are ‘rained’ down in circles from sprinklers, so a lot of ground can be covered. However, as water is sent from a height to a wider area, it is not as efficient as other types of irrigation.

Sprinklers can be left to irrigate your crops until they need to be moved or stopped, giving you more time to do other things such as farm work or a well-deserved rest.

Drip line irrigating new crops

DRIP

We are seeing more and more drip irrigation used on smallholder farms and there is a good reason why – it is one of the most efficient ways to irrigate your crops!

It is called drip as this method uses hose pipes with small holes or nozzles along it to drip feed water to the base of your plants. These are known as drip lines and are laid along where your crops are planted. Water is usually supplied to the drip lines from tanks, using gravity to power the slow flow of the water. Water pumps are used to get water into the water tanks.

Drip is very efficient as water is slowly given to the base of your plants throughout the day, reducing over-watering, evaporation and water loss. It also allows you to do other things as you can leave it to irrigate (how about another rest!)

However, drip irrigation can be difficult to move around your farm and does require the purchase of drip lines, a water tank and potentially other equipment, which makes it a more expensive option.

Home-made mist irrigation
Home-made mist irrigation
MIST

Mist is less common on smallholder farms.

Mist irrigation works by spraying a fine ‘mist’ of water onto your crops. It is similar in a way to drip, in that water is put through small holes or nozzles but at a higher pressure. This allows you to water quicker and a wider area, but it is less efficient.

Again, mist can be left to irrigate while you do other things but it also requires the purchase of equipment, such as a water tank or water pump, so it has higher start-up costs.

Manual irrigation of crops during the dry season
Manual irrigation of crops during the dry season
MANUAL

Manual irrigation is by far the most common form of irrigation as anyone physically able to, can manually irrigate their crops.

Manual irrigation is you moving water from plant to plant. This is very labour and time intensive and is usually done with a hose or bucket, so it is only suitable for smaller areas.

These ways are also the least efficient as you have less control over the water, and it is usually delivered in larger quantities that are not as good for the plant and can increase run-off from your farm.

However, this is financially the cheapest way to irrigate your farm and it is currently the only easily available option for many smallholders, especially in dry seasons.


Flooding the soil
FURROW OR FLOOD

This is the practice of flooding the soil around your plants, sometimes using furrows (troughs) between raised ridges where your plants grow.

This type of irrigation needs large amounts of water, usually supplied with a water pump. Also, you will need to plan and plant your crops with ridges and furrows.

It is quite an inefficient way to irrigate, as pools of water will evaporate easily, especially in warm, sunny conditions. Plus with the large volumes of water you could lose some from your farm in run-off.

HOW CAN FUTUREPUMP HELP YOU IRRIGATE?

The Futurepump SF2 water pump getting water from an underground tank to crops during the dry season
Futurepump make solar water pumps that help you quickly and easily move water from your water source to irrigate your crops. All the above photos showing the irrigation types have the water being supplied by the Futurepump SF2 solar pump!

By using solar to power the water pump there are no fuel costs and no harmful pollutants on your farm. Solar powered irrigation keeps things as sustainable and as efficient as possible. Other ways to get water for irrigation include manually move the water which is time consuming and tiresome, or using fossil fuel pumps which are costly, very inefficient and polluting.

If you would like more details on this, handily, we have a recent blog that provides a lot more details on water pumps for irrigation!

Our solar water pumps can be used with all the irrigation types shown in this blog and our distributors will be able to help you find what is right for you.
